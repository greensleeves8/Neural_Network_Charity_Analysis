# Neural Network Charity Analysis

Using Neural Networks to analyze charitable organizations

## Overview of the Analysis

Using our knowledge of machine learning and neural networks, we were tasked with creating
a binary classifier that is capable of predicting whether charitable organizations applying
to receive money from Alphabet Soup will be successful if funded. 

## Results

- Data Preprocessing:
	- The target of our neural network analysis was the "IS_SUCCESSFUL" column. The purpose
of our analysis was to determine whether the organizations selected would ultimately be successful
if they were to receive funding.
